# Empath

NOTE: This is a Work in Progress, and is somewhat vibe coded as an expirement. I do plan to fix it up should I get the time.

Empath is an MTA written in rust. It is intended to not only be a standard MTA, but also one that is easy to debug,
and also provide the ability to test any MTA directly.
