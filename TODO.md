## Phase 0: Code Review Follow-ups & Production Blockers

### 🔴 0.27+0.28 Authentication Infrastructure [COMBINED]
**Priority**: Critical (Production Blocker)
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: None
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Not Started
**Risk**: Medium
**Tags**: security, production
**Updated**: 2025-11-16

**Problem**: Metrics endpoint (localhost:9090) and control socket have no authentication - security vulnerability.

**Solution**: Implement shared token-based authentication for both control socket and metrics endpoint.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Token-based auth for control socket commands
- [ ] API key auth for metrics endpoint
- [ ] Configuration via empath.config.ron
- [ ] Documentation updated in CLAUDE.md and SECURITY.md

---

### 🔴 0.35+0.36 Distributed Tracing Pipeline [COMBINED]
**Priority**: Critical (Production Monitoring)
**Effort**: 3-4 days
**Dependencies**: Best with 0.13 (E2E tests for validation)
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Not Started
**Risk**: Medium
**Tags**: observability, monitoring
**Updated**: 2025-11-16

**Problem**:
- OTEL Collector only has metrics pipeline, no trace export backend
- Cannot trace requests through SMTP → Spool → Delivery
- No trace_id/span_id in logs - cannot correlate metrics → traces → logs

**Solution**:
- Implement OTLP trace export pipeline to Jaeger/Tempo
- Add trace context propagation across service boundaries
- Inject trace_id/span_id into all log entries

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] OTLP trace pipeline configured in docker/otel-collector.yml
- [ ] Jaeger/Tempo backend running in Docker stack
- [ ] Trace context propagates from SMTP → Delivery
- [ ] trace_id/span_id appear in all logs
- [ ] Can trace a message end-to-end in <30 seconds

**Technical Notes**: Migrate #[traced] macro from logs to actual OTel spans (see task 5.4)

---

### 🔴 0.13 / 2.3 Comprehensive E2E Test Suite
**Priority**: Critical (Testing Infrastructure)
**Effort**: 3-5 days
**Dependencies**: 4.2 (MockSmtpServer) - ✅ COMPLETED
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Not Started
**Risk**: High (blocks architecture refactoring 4.0)
**Tags**: testing, quality
**Updated**: 2025-11-16

**Problem**:
- Inverted test pyramid (113 unit tests, ~10 integration, 0 E2E)
- Cannot validate full delivery flow (SMTP → Spool → Delivery → External SMTP)
- Cannot test failure scenarios (DNS timeout, TLS failure, recipient rejection)
- Blocks safe refactoring (task 4.0 requires E2E coverage)

**Solution**: Build comprehensive E2E test suite using completed MockSmtpServer

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] E2E test: Full delivery flow (SMTP receive → spool → DNS → SMTP delivery → success)
- [ ] E2E test: TLS upgrade during reception and delivery
- [ ] E2E test: DNS resolution with caching
- [ ] E2E test: Retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] E2E test: Message persistence across restarts
- [ ] E2E test: Graceful shutdown with in-flight messages
- [ ] All tests run in CI (depends on 7.16)

---

### 🔵 0.12 Add More Control Commands [PARTIAL - Process-Now Complete]
**Priority**: Low
**Effort**: 2-3 days for remaining commands
**Dependencies**: None
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Partial (ProcessNow ✅, others pending)
**Tags**: control-socket, operations

**Completed**: Manual queue processing (`empathctl queue process-now`)

**Remaining Commands**:
1. Config reload - Reload configuration without restart
2. Log level adjustment - Change log verbosity at runtime
3. Connection stats - View active SMTP connections
4. Rate limit adjustments - Modify per-domain rate limits

---

### 🔵 0.13 Add Authentication/Authorization for Control Socket
**Priority**: Low (Unix permissions sufficient for now)
**Effort**: 1 day
**Dependencies**: None
**Status**: Deferred
**Tags**: security

**Note**: Merged into 0.27+0.28 for token-based auth. This task covers optional multi-user authorization (ACLs, role-based access).

**Options**:
1. Unix permissions (current approach - sufficient for single-user)
2. Token-based auth (covered by 0.27+0.28)
3. Role-based access control (future enhancement)

---

### 🔵 0.14 Add DNSSEC Validation and Logging
**Priority**: Low (Downgraded - Premature)
**Effort**: 2 days
**Dependencies**: None
**Status**: Deferred
**Tags**: dns, security

**Expert Review**: Premature - no DNSSEC infrastructure in most deployments. Defer until core reliability proven.

Enable DNSSEC validation in resolver and log validation status for security monitoring.

---

### ❌ 0.3 Fix Context/Message Layer Violation **REJECTED**
**Status**: Rejected (2025-11-11)

**Decision**: NOT a layer violation - intentional architectural feature for module system.

**Rationale**: Context persistence enables module lifecycle tracking across SMTP reception → delivery. "Session-only" fields (id, metadata, extended, banner) are part of the module contract, allowing plugins to maintain coherent state. Storage overhead negligible (~100 bytes vs 4KB-10MB+ emails).

**See**: CLAUDE.md "Context Persistence and the Module Contract" section

---

## Phase 1: Core Functionality

### 🔴 1.1 Restore Queue State from Spool on Restart [UPGRADE TO CRITICAL]
**Priority**: Critical (Durability)
**Effort**: 1 week
**Dependencies**: 0.3 analysis (completed - design validated)
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Ready to start
**Risk**: High (touches delivery core)
**Tags**: delivery, durability, queue
**Updated**: 2025-11-16

**Problem**: On restart, delivery queue state (retry schedules, attempt counts, next_retry_at timestamps) is not restored from the persistent spool. Messages in the spool are rediscovered but queue metadata is lost. This causes immediate redelivery attempts instead of honoring exponential backoff.

**Solution**: On startup, scan FileBackedSpool and restore queue state from Context.delivery fields in spooled messages.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] On startup, read all .bin files from spool directory
- [ ] Deserialize Context.delivery (attempt_count, next_retry_at, server_index, status)
- [ ] Populate in-memory DeliveryQueue with restored state
- [ ] Honor next_retry_at timestamps (don't retry immediately)
- [ ] Tests verify queue state restoration across restart
- [ ] Performance impact <5% on startup (benchmark with 10k queued messages)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Spool (FileBackedSpool) is already persistent - this is about restoring queue STATE
- Leverage Context.delivery design validated in task 0.3 rejection analysis
- Queue reads from spool, not the other way around

---

### 🟢 1.2.1 DNSSEC Validation
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: None
**Status**: Deferred (same as 0.14)

See task 0.14 - merged/duplicate.

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: None
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Not Started
**Risk**: Medium
**Tags**: performance, delivery

**Problem**: Outbound SMTP connections established per delivery attempt - overhead for high-volume domains.

**Solution**: Implement connection pool for SMTP client to reuse connections to same MX servers.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Connection pool with configurable size per domain
- [ ] Idle connection timeout and cleanup
- [ ] Connection health checks before reuse
- [ ] Metrics: pool_size, pool_hits, pool_misses
- [ ] Performance improvement >20% for high-volume domains (benchmark)

---

**Effort**: 3-5 days
**Dependencies**: 4.5 (JoinSet) - ✅ COMPLETED
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Ready to start
**Risk**: Medium
**Tags**: performance, scalability

**Problem**: Single-threaded delivery limits throughput to ~100 messages/sec.

**Solution**: Implement parallel delivery using JoinSet for concurrent processing.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Configurable parallelism (default: num_cpus)
- [ ] Per-domain rate limiting preserved
- [ ] Graceful shutdown waits for in-flight deliveries
- [ ] Throughput improvement >5x (benchmark)
- [ ] No race conditions (stress testing with 10k concurrent deliveries)

---

### 🟢 3.3 Rate Limiting per Domain [UPGRADE TO HIGH]
**Priority**: High (DoS Prevention)
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: None
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Not Started
**Risk**: Medium
**Tags**: security, performance

**Problem**: No rate limiting - can overwhelm recipient servers, causing blacklisting. DoS vulnerability.

**Solution**: Implement per-domain rate limiting with token bucket algorithm.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Configurable rate limits per domain (messages/second, messages/hour)
- [ ] Default global rate limit (e.g., 10 msg/sec per domain)
- [ ] Override limits for specific domains via config
- [ ] Metrics: rate_limited_total, rate_limit_delay_seconds
- [ ] Tests verify rate limiting behavior

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 1 week
**Dependencies**: None
**Status**: Not Started
**Tags**: delivery, compliance

**Problem**: No DSN (Delivery Status Notification) support - senders don't know delivery failures.

**Solution**: Implement RFC 3464 DSN generation for failed deliveries.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] DSN generated for permanent failures (5xx errors)
- [ ] DSN generated after max retry attempts
- [ ] DSN includes original message headers
- [ ] DSN complies with RFC 3464 format
- [ ] Configurable: enable/disable DSN per domain

---

### 🟡 3.6 Comprehensive Audit Logging [UPGRADE TO HIGH]
**Priority**: High (Compliance)
**Effort**: 3-4 days
**Dependencies**: None
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Partial (control commands ✅, message lifecycle pending)
**Risk**: Low
**Tags**: compliance, security, logging
**Updated**: 2025-11-16

**Problem**: Email systems are compliance-critical (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX). Control commands logged (task 0.17 ✅), but missing message lifecycle auditing.

**Solution**: Add structured audit logging for full message lifecycle with PII redaction.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] MessageReceived event (timestamp, sender, recipients, message_id, size)
- [ ] DeliveryAttempt event (message_id, domain, server, attempt_count, result)
- [ ] DeliverySuccess event (message_id, domain, server, duration)
- [ ] DeliveryFailure event (message_id, domain, error, next_retry)
- [ ] PII redaction configurable (email addresses, message content)
- [ ] SIEM integration via structured JSON logs
- [ ] Retention policy compliance (configurable retention period)

---

## Phase 4: Code Structure & Technical Debt

### 🔴 4.0 Code Structure Refactoring [BLOCKED BY 0.13]
**Priority**: Critical (for 1.0), Deferred (until after E2E tests)
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies**: **BLOCKED by 0.13** (requires E2E coverage), NEW-02 (unwrap audit), NEW-08 (unsafe audit)
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Blocked
**Risk**: Very High (major architecture changes)
**Tags**: architecture, refactoring
**Updated**: 2025-11-16

**Problem**: DeliveryProcessor is "God Object" with 8+ responsibilities. SMTP session tightly coupled to protocol parsing.

**Solution**: Extract service layers, separate concerns, apply SOLID principles.

**Breakdown**:
- [ ] 4.0.1 - Extract delivery DNS resolution (3 days)
- [ ] 4.0.2 - Separate SMTP session from protocol FSM (4 days)
- [ ] 4.0.3 - Create unified error types (2 days)
- [ ] 4.0.4 - Consolidate configuration structs (3 days)

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All existing tests pass unchanged
- [ ] E2E tests validate behavior preservation
- [ ] Clippy strict mode passes
- [ ] No performance regression (benchmark comparison)

**⚠️ DO NOT START**: Until task 0.13 (E2E tests) complete. Refactoring without E2E coverage = disaster.

---

- [ ] Configurable timeout (e.g., 5 minutes open state)
- [ ] Metrics: circuit_breaker_state{domain}, circuit_breaker_trips_total
- [ ] Tests verify state transitions

**Expert Review**: Upgrade to HIGH - prevents thundering herd to failing domains.

---

### 🟢 5.2 Configuration Hot Reload
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: None
**Status**: Not Started

**Solution**: Implement configurable TLS policies per domain (Opportunistic, Required, Disabled).

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] TLS policy: Opportunistic (try TLS, fall back to plaintext)
- [ ] TLS policy: Required (fail if TLS unavailable)
- [ ] TLS policy: Disabled (never use TLS - testing only)
- [ ] Per-domain policy overrides
- [ ] Metrics: tls_handshake_failures_total{domain,policy}

---

### 🟡 5.4 Enhanced Tracing with Spans
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: 0.35+0.36 (trace pipeline must exist first)
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Blocked
**Tags**: observability, tracing

**Problem**: `#[traced]` macro generates logs, not OpenTelemetry spans. Cannot see delivery pipeline phases in traces.

**Solution**: Migrate #[traced] macro from logs to actual OTel span instrumentation.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Span hierarchy: SMTP session → Data command → Spool → Delivery → DNS → TLS → SMTP handshake
- [ ] Span attributes: message_id, sender, recipient, domain, server
- [ ] Span events: Command received, FSM transition, Module validation
- [ ] Flamegraph visualization in Jaeger shows full pipeline
- [ ] #[traced] macro generates both spans and logs

---

## NEW TASKS (Identified by Expert Review)

### ✅ NEW-01 FFI Safety Hardening (Null Byte Validation) **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: Critical (Production Blocker)
**Effort**: 1-2 days (actual: 1 day)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-11-16
**Owner**: Claude
**Tags**: ffi, security, rust
**Added**: 2025-11-16 (Rust Expert Review)

**Problem**: FFI code in `empath-ffi/src/string.rs` (lines 48, 64, 74) used `.expect("Invalid CString")` which panicked if input contained null bytes. Malicious modules could crash MTA.

**Solution Implemented**: Created `sanitize_null_bytes()` helper function that filters null bytes from input strings before CString creation.

**Completed Criteria**:
- [x] All `CString::new().expect()` replaced with null byte sanitization
- [x] 4 new test functions with 15+ test cases verify null byte handling
- [x] CLAUDE.md updated with security documentation
- [x] Consistent implementation across all three From impls (DRY principle)

**Files Modified**:
- `empath-ffi/src/string.rs` - Added sanitization helper, updated all From implementations
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added FFI null byte sanitization security documentation

**Commits**:
- `1147fb3` - Initial null byte sanitization implementation

### 🔴 NEW-06 Structured JSON Logging with Trace Correlation
**Priority**: Critical (Before Production)
**Effort**: 1-2 days
**Dependencies**: 0.35+0.36 (trace context propagation)
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Blocked
**Risk**: Low
**Tags**: observability, logging
**Added**: 2025-11-16 (OTel Expert Review)

**Problem**: Text logs via `tracing_subscriber::fmt` - cannot search by message_id, trace_id. No structured logging for machine parsing.

**Solution**: Replace text logs with JSON formatter, inject trace context.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] JSON structured logging (tracing_subscriber::fmt::json)
- [ ] trace_id/span_id in all log entries (via tracing-opentelemetry layer)
- [ ] Fields: message_id, sender, recipient, domain, smtp_code, delivery_attempt
- [ ] LogQL queries work: `{service="empath"} | json | message_id="abc123"`

**Impact**: 90% reduction in log investigation time.

### 🔴 NEW-07 Log Aggregation Pipeline (Loki Integration)
**Priority**: Critical (Before Production)
**Effort**: 1-2 days
**Dependencies**: NEW-06 (JSON logging)
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Blocked
**Risk**: Medium
**Tags**: observability, logging
**Added**: 2025-11-16 (OTel Expert Review)

**Problem**: Production deployments have multiple instances - cannot SSH to containers to tail logs. No centralized log search.

**Solution**: Add Loki to Docker Compose stack for log aggregation.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Loki service in `docker/compose.dev.yml`
- [ ] Promtail ships logs from containers
- [ ] Loki datasource in Grafana
- [ ] 7-day retention with compression

### 🟡 NEW-08 Unsafe Code Documentation Audit
**Priority**: High (Before Production)
**Effort**: 1-2 days
**Dependencies**: None
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Partial (MIRI testing exists in CI)
**Risk**: High (memory safety)
**Tags**: rust, safety, ffi
**Added**: 2025-11-16 (Rust Expert Review)
**Updated**: 2025-11-16 (MIRI testing already runs in `.gitea/workflows/test.yml`)

**Problem**: 12 files contain `unsafe` blocks. While MIRI tests run in CI (`.gitea/workflows/test.yml:88`), each unsafe block needs formal SAFETY documentation per Rust RFC 1122.

**Solution**: Document all unsafe blocks with safety invariants.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All unsafe blocks documented with SAFETY comments (invariants, assumptions, testing)
- [ ] `docs/UNSAFE_AUDIT.md` formal audit document
- [ ] Security reviewer sign-off

**Files to Audit**:
- `empath-ffi/src/lib.rs` (10 unsafe blocks)
- `empath-ffi/src/string.rs` (4 unsafe blocks)
- All other files with `unsafe`

**Note**: MIRI testing already runs in CI via `MIRIFLAGS="-Zmiri-disable-isolation" cargo miri nextest run`. This task is about documentation, not testing.

### 🟡 NEW-09 Newtype Pattern Extension for Type Safety
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: 4.4 (Domain newtype) - ✅ COMPLETED
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Ready to start
**Risk**: Low
**Tags**: rust, type-safety, refactoring
**Added**: 2025-11-16 (Rust Expert Review)

**Problem**: Task 4.4 created `Domain` newtype - excellent! But other string types lack compile-time safety: EmailAddress, ServerId, BannerHostname.

**Solution**: Create newtypes for email addresses, server IDs, hostnames.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] `EmailAddress` newtype with validation (contains '@')
- [ ] `ServerId` newtype for MX server addresses
- [ ] `BannerHostname` newtype for SMTP banners
- [ ] Zero runtime overhead (#[repr(transparent)])
- [ ] Compile-time prevention of domain/email confusion bugs

### 🟡 NEW-10 Nightly Feature Stability Plan
**Priority**: High (Before 1.0 Release)
**Effort**: 1-2 days
**Dependencies**: None
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Not Started
**Risk**: High (crates.io publication blocker)
**Tags**: rust, stability, release
**Added**: 2025-11-16 (Rust Expert Review)

**Problem**: Project uses Edition 2024 (nightly) with unstable features. Cannot publish to crates.io, enterprise users require stable Rust.

**Solution**: Audit nightly features, create migration plan to stable Rust.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] `docs/NIGHTLY_FEATURES.md` - Feature audit and tracking
- [ ] Conditional compilation fallbacks for critical features
- [ ] CI job testing on stable Rust (expected to fail with clear errors)
- [ ] Migration timeline documented (target: stable Rust by 1.0 release Q3 2025)

**Nightly Features Used**: ascii_char, associated_type_defaults, iter_advance_by, result_option_map_or_default, slice_pattern, vec_into_raw_parts, fn_traits, unboxed_closures

### 🟡 NEW-11 Panic Safety Audit for Production
**Priority**: High (Production Readiness)
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: NEW-02 (Unwrap audit)
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Not Started
**Risk**: High
**Tags**: rust, safety
**Added**: 2025-11-16 (Rust Expert Review)

**Problem**: 27 `panic!`, `todo!`, `unimplemented!`, `unreachable!` calls. Production code must not panic except for proven invariants.

**Solution**: Classify all panic calls, replace lazy panics with Result, document proven invariants.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All `todo!` markers completed before 1.0
- [ ] Lazy panics replaced with proper error handling
- [ ] Proven invariants documented with proof comments
- [ ] CI lint: deny clippy::panic, clippy::todo, clippy::unimplemented (except in tests)

**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Not Started
**Risk**: Low
**Tags**: testing, quality
**Added**: 2025-11-16 (DX Expert Review)

**Problem**: Only example-based unit tests - edge cases may be missed. No fuzz testing for SMTP/DNS parsers.

**Solution**: Add proptest/quickcheck for property-based testing of parsers.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Property tests for SMTP command parsing (roundtrip, valid inputs)
- [ ] Property tests for email address parsing
- [ ] Property tests for DNS response parsing
- [ ] Property tests run in CI
- [ ] Fuzz testing integration (cargo fuzz - optional)

**Note**: Replaces/expands task 6.7.

- ✅ `changelog.yml` - git-cliff changelog generation on tags
- ✅ `release.yml` - Docker image building and registry push
- ✅ `cliff.toml` - Changelog configuration (verified exists)
- ✅ Automatic release uploads with generated changelog

**Locations**:
- `.gitea/workflows/changelog.yml`
- `.gitea/workflows/release.yml`
- `cliff.toml` (root)

**Note**: Release and changelog automation fully implemented. May want to add `just changelog` command for convenience.

### 🟡 NEW-15 Production SLO Dashboard
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 1 day
**Dependencies**: Queue age metrics (completed)
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Status**: Not Started
**Risk**: Low
**Tags**: observability, monitoring
**Added**: 2025-11-16 (OTel Expert Review)

**Problem**: Raw metrics exist but no SLO definitions. Cannot measure reliability objectively.

**Solution**: Define SLOs and create Grafana dashboard.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] SLO definitions documented (99.5% delivery success, p95 queue age <5min)
- [ ] SLO compliance gauge (Green/Yellow/Red based on error budget)
- [ ] Error budget remaining (days until budget exhausted)
- [ ] Burn rate alerts (fast burn triggers escalation)
- [ ] Historical SLO compliance (30-day trend)
